fdm is a finite difference 3d visualization with JavaScript and python


## Details

FDM matrices update the mesh based on user applied  energy and initial conditions. Before every animation loop, a color map is applied based on high and low values. Stars out with Dirichlet boundary conditions (completely reflective, like a string tied to a wall) or you can choose the Nuemann conditions where the mesh is free to move
